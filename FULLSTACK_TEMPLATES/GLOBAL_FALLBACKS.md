Global Fallbacks
================

If context is missing or inconsistent:
- Ask only the minimal targeted questions to resolve gaps.
- If answers are unavailable, record assumptions explicitly in the session log.
- Create a recovery snapshot before proceeding to the next decision gate.
- Require explicit user approval before continuing.
