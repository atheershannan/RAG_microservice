Features Workspace
==================

New features are created under `/features/<feature_name>/` with the following structure:

backend/
frontend/
tests/
docs/FEATURE_SPEC.md
DIALOGUES/
SESSION_LOGS/
changelog.md
README.md

Use `FEATURE_LIFECYCLE_MANAGER.prompt` to add/update/retire features safely.
