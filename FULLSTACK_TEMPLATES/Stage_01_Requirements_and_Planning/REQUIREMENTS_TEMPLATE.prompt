# Stage 01 — Requirements & Planning (Adaptive)

## Intent
Establish clear users, goals, constraints, and success metrics. Enforce adaptive questioning.

## Context Scan
- Read: ROADMAP.md, PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md, FEATURES_REGISTRY.md, GLOBAL_LOG.md
- Detect: Missing/outdated/conflicts

## Adaptive Questions
- Ask only for missing or conflicting details:
  - Target users, primary jobs-to-be-done
  - Non-functionals (SLOs, latency, scale, compliance)
  - Risks and constraints (budget, timeline)
  - Success metrics (KPIs, OKRs)

## Outputs
- Updated user types, goals, constraints, metrics
- Save Q/A transcript to ./SESSION_LOGS/{{TIMESTAMP}}_requirements_session.md
- Append decision summary to PROJECT_EVOLUTION_LOG.md

## Unlock Condition
- `CHECKLIST.md` satisfied and approved
